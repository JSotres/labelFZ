# labelFZ
Application for labelling points of interest in AFM force ramps/curves.

## Quick start
1. Download/clone/fork the repo.
2. The app should work for any python 3.x. The easiest way to work with it would be from a virtual environment. A requirement file is provided. You can create it eg by going to the app main dir and then in the command line:
```
python3 -m venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Then, from the command line just run:
```
python -m labelFZ
```
